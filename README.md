# invento-test
Multi-Tenant Flat &amp; Bill Management System <br>

This is the test task assigned to me. I was supposed to submit it earlier, but as I am currently employed, it took me extra time to complete. <br>

The Documentation folder includes server requirements, installation instructions, and other details. <br>

The Files folder contains the Laravel project along with a sample database. <br>

Below are the live project URL and details.<br>

Admin login URL and credentials : <br>
<a href="https://phinix.digital/invento-test/admin" target="_blank">Admin Panel</a><br>
Username : admin <br>
password : admin <br><br>

User login URL and credentials : <br>
<a href="https://phinix.digital/invento-test/user/login" target="_blank">User Panel (Houser Owner)</a><br>
Username : demouser <br>
password : demouser <br>
