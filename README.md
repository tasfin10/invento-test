# invento-test
Multi-Tenant Flat &amp; Bill Management System <br>

This is the test task assigned to me. I was supposed to submit it earlier, but as I am currently employed, it took me extra time to complete. <br>

The Documentation folder includes server requirements, installation instructions, and other details. <br>

The Files folder contains the Laravel project along with a sample database. <br>

Thank you for your understanding, and I look forward to your feedback. <br>

Regards
